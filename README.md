# AI Note Taker
A clientside-only webapp that uses OpenAI's whisper and GPT models to transcribe audio and convert the transcript to notes, summaries, or other more concise content.

The app requires that you supply your own OpenAI API key so you are solely responsible for your inputs and their associated cost.

The webapp is hosted using GitHub Pages and it's available at <https://notetaker.cybah.me>.
